# republic-of-trust
Republic of Trust is a smart contract for voting and analyzing sites on the web for a safer experience. It also provides a script for performing a sentiment and entity analysis on request by the user for a certain URL. It is part of a larger initiative for a 'Web of Trust'.

I have also issued a Pull Request for adding the snippets for a smart contract UI template, here is the link:

A README is provided in the fork containing the Twitter post with a delightful GIF! (and other technical details,of course)

This application participates with <3 in the New York Blockchain Week Hackathon!
